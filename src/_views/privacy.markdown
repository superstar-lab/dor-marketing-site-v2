# Dor Technologies, Inc.

### Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes Dor Technologies, Inc.’s privacy practices for its products, including the Dor hardware and software, available through or in connection with the Dor Technologies website and the Dor Technologies mobile apps (collectively, the “Service”). Throughout the policy, we refer to information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, company's name, contact names, email addresses, phone numbers or credit card number, if as and when required as "personal information."

### **Collection of personal information**

We collect personal information in the normal course of business in order to better service your account.

*   We begin collecting personal information from you when you register with the Service. You may register as an end customer or print service provider (end customer and print service provider are sometimes collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Customer") through the sign-up page on the Service which may require your name, company's name, email address, phone numbers and, if you are creating an account, your password.

*   We, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, or affiliates may contact you to survey your satisfaction with the Dor Products and/or to inform you of additional products and services. You may opt out of receiving these additional communications from us by following the opt-out procedures included here and otherwise provided.

### **Disclosure of personal information**

We do not disclose your personal information to third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:

*   We may disclose your personal information to other companies that help us process or service your account or correspond with you. For example, we may provide your personal information to a service provider to verify the validity or credit limit of your credit card. The companies that we hire to assist us with processing or servicing your account or correspond with you are not allowed to use your personal information for their own purposes and are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality.

*   We may disclose or report your personal information when we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required or permitted under law, for example, to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities or to resolve consumer disputes.

### **Anonymous information**

We gather anonymous information about you to provide the Service, as well as for our internal purposes, and we may share this anonymous information with third parties.

*   Anonymous information is any information that does not personally identify you, including aggregate demographic information such as the number of visitors to the Service from a particular state or country.

*   We use anonymous information primarily for marketing purposes and to improve the services offered through the Service.

*   We may use "cookies," "clear gifs," internet protocol addresses and other monitoring technologies to gather anonymous information.

    *   "Cookies" are small files that are stored by your web browser to help a particular system recognize you and the pages you visited in a website. The Service uses cookies to make your online experience more convenient. For example, we may use a cookie to store your account information between sessions and to maintain information about the quotes you've requested during your session. Additionally, we may use data from cookies for a variety of internal purposes, such as studying how users navigate the Service. We do not collect any personal information from cookies. Further, no other information we collect from cookies can be linked back to your personal information. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies.

    *   "Clear gifs" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies that are used to track the online movements of website users. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies. We do not collect any personal information from clear gifs. Further, no information we collect from clear gifs can be linked back to your personal information.

*   We use third party web analytics services to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume statistical information from visitors to help us administer the Service, improve the Service's performance and to report website traffic. These web analytics services use cookies, clear gifs and other web monitoring technologies to help track visitor behavior on our behalf. These services do not use these technologies to collect any personally identifiable information from website visitors.

### **Emailing through your Dor account**

As part of the service offered through the Service, users of certain Dor Products may send a file to one or more recipients by email. The message created by a user of such Dor Products will be sent on the user's behalf to the email addresses specified by the user during the "send file" process. Email addresses will be stored in the address book created by the user and will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communications.

### **Social Media Accounts**

The Service may enable you to register, or allow you to contact others, through your social media accounts, such as your Facebook®, LinkedIn®, or Google+®/Gmail® accounts. To the extent it does and you use these features, you may be asked to allow the Service to access your contacts in that account. Be assured that we do not use such contact information for anything other than as necessary to take the permitted actions you request. Of course, the personal information contained in your social media accounts is subject to the privacy policies of the companies operating those accounts, and you should review those policies to be clear on those companies’ collection and use of your information.

### **Security safeguards**

We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information.

*   We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.

*   The password you enter when you create an account on the Service provides you with private access to the Service and its services. You should never share it with anyone. Your password must be six characters long (with any combination of numbers and/or letters).

### **Updating personal information**

We continually evaluate our efforts to protect your personal information and make every effort to keep your personal information accurate and up to date. If you want to correct or update your contact information, you may contact us by email at support@getdor.com or by mail at Dor Support Team, 101A Clay Street #136, San Francisco, CA 94111.

### **Phishing**

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID or login password in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's web site.

### **Information sharing and disclosure**

Other than as described in this section, we do not rent or share information about you with third parties.

Posting File Comments: Users of the Service may have the ability to post comments in connection with the Services. Any information you choose to provide in a comment should reflect how much you want other users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage you to think carefully about what information you disclose in your comments. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information you choose to submit in a comment and will not treat such information as personal information for the purpose of this privacy policy.

### **Changing or deleting your information**

All subscribers to the Dor Services may review, update, correct or delete the personal information in their registration profile by logging into their account and changing the "user preferences" associated with their account. In order to disable your account, please submit a support request to support@getdor.com.

### **Data retention**

We may retain your account information and the data collected in connection with your use of the service indefinitely regardless of whether you have disabled your account on the Service. We will retain log data in accordance with applicable legal requirements. In the event of an investigation by law enforcement or in connection with our response to claims or legal process, we may retain the log data until such investigation or process is completed.

### **Security**

We take safeguarding your information very seriously. We employ generally-accepted, industry-standard administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the personal information from unauthorized access, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic data storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security.

### **International transfer**

Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province or country where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, you should be aware that we transfer personal information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to such transfer.

### **Links to other sites**

The Service may contain links to other third party web sites. If you choose to visit a third party Service, such as an advertiser, by clicking on a banner ad or clicking on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's web site. The fact that the Service presents links to third party websites or presents banner or other types of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party web sites. These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other web sites you visit.

### **Our policy toward children**

This Service is not directed to children under the age of 18\. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13\. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without their consent, the parent or guardian should contact us at 101A Clay Street #136, San Francisco, CA 94111\. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our files.

### **Changes in privacy practices**

If we are going to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your personal information in this different manner. If we make material changes to our privacy practices that do not affect the personal information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice in the privacy policy of our website notifying customers of the change.

### **Opt out**

We may contact you via e-mail to survey your satisfaction of our service and/or to inform you of additional products and services.

If you want to opt out of these surveys and/or notices, you may reply to any e-mail that we send you by including the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line of your e-mail.

Please note that you will still receive communications from us regarding your account even if you opt out of receiving our surveys and/or notices of additional products and services.

### **Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of the Service that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to support@getdor.com. Please include the phrase “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email or on the envelope or post card and in the actual request. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.

### **Application of privacy policy**

The information privacy practices described in this privacy policy apply only to subscription accounts initiated on the Service. Accordingly, all of the personal information you submit to us after establishing an account on the Service shall be governed by this privacy policy. Additionally, all of the anonymous information collected from the Service shall be governed by this privacy policy.

This privacy policy applies to this Service, and may not apply to other websites that are owned and/or operated by Dor Technologies, Inc. and/or its affiliates.
