    text: "In retail, you’ve got to know your traffic and your conversion of that traffic. Without it, you leave way too many things to assumption. <br><br>I can actually look at my managers now and say, ‘You dropped six percent in conversions.’ They understand now the cost of people walking out without getting to the register. I’m actually putting financial reasoning behind this stuff."

    text: "I just installed another one of our Dor sensors today, took me not even five minutes. I don’t know anybody who couldn’t install it. <br><br> So far it’s been incredibly reliable. I have zero complaints and I’m just excited to continue to get data and be able to do something with it."

    company: Senior Director, 4 Wheel Parts
    text: "Our challenge as a 95-store operation, we don’t have a lot of infrastructure to make meaning out of all that data… [when needing to know how many people would be coming through the door] you wind up investing into a tool that would take us into foot traffic warp speed."

  questions:
    - title: "What is foot traffic and why is it so important for retailers?"

    - title: "What are the factors that affect foot traffic for retailers?"
      text: "There are numerous factors that influence the number of people that visit your store every day including seasonality, marketing spending and type of business.<br/><br/> Weather is one of the most important factors to consider. Every location has different weather conditions and they can often drive foot traffic up or down. Location is another prominent factor. It is worth noting how foot traffic is varied in locations in higher density areas versus locations in lesser trafficked places."

    - title: "How can independent retailers use door counters?"
      text: "Unlike enterprise retailers with hundreds of physical stores, independent retailers (or small businesses - SMBs) usually have between one and five stores. <br/><br/>Independent retailers should be tracking their stores’ foot traffic in order to have an in-depth understanding about their stores’ performance. By integrating a people counter to their POS, small business owners can easily see their conversion rates. Understanding individual store performance, allows them to make strategic and data driven decisions. Moreover, traffic counters show retailers store peak hours in order to optimize staff scheduling."

    - title: "How can enterprise retailers use people counting technologies?"
      text: "With dozens or hundreds of stores, enterprise retailers have no choice but to use foot traffic counters to make strategic data driven decisions.<br/><br/>One of the key ways enterprise retailers can utilize a customer counter is by comparing foot traffic and conversion rates across different store locations to see overall performance. With this information, retailers can change retail strategy where needed and determine store openings and closures based on their own foot traffic data.<br/><br/>Some people counters allow you to use their API to connect the traffic data to your own data hubs."

    - title: "How can facilities and offices use people counting systems?"
      text: "Foot traffic for facilities, offices and buildings can be tracked by the same hardware as retailers, but gather completely different insights.<br/><br/>Building, office and facility owners or managers use people counters to understand how spaces are being occupied and how they can make smarter decisions to optimize space usage. Furthermore, people counting solutions can be used for property and real-estate management decisions as it’s a great way to decrease your costs based on your space usage data.<br/><br/>People counters can also be used for restroom maintenance, lunch area and meeting room usage."
